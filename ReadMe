Makefile:      Does standard tasks such as building the application,
               cleaning up unneeded files, running tests, and
               performing style checks.  Used as a configuration file by 
               the 'gmake' program.

graph/  Package containing general graph-related data types.
               
        Makefile:
               See above.
               
        Graph.java:
               Interface defining what a "graph" is.
               
        GraphObj.java:
               A non-public partial implementation of Graph.java containing
               code common to directed and undirected graphs.

        DirectedGraph.java:
               Implementation of directed graphs.
               
        UndirectedGraph.java:
               Implementation of undirected graphs.
               
        GraphFilter.java:
               A utility implementation of Graphs (intended to be extended)
               that simply delegates all operations to a previously existing
               Graph.  Used by LabeledGraph.

        LabeledGraph.java:
               A graph that adds labels to vertices and edges of a previously
               existing Graph.

        Traversal.java:
               Represents a general traversal of a graph.

        BreadthFirstTraversal.java:
               An implementation of Traversal for breadth-first traversal.

        DepthFirstTraversal.java:
               An implementation of Traversal for depth-first traversal.

        ShortestPaths.java:
               Represents a shortest-path tree or single shortest path on
               a graph, using Dijkstra's algorithms and A* search.

        SimpleShortestPaths.java:
               An implementation of ShortestPaths.java that provides weighting
               information separately from the underlying Graph.

        Iteration.java:
               Abstract class that allows Iterators to be used in foreach
	       loops (for (T x : E) { ... }).

        Test-related:
               
        UnitTest.java:
                Dispatcher for JUnit tests for graph package.

        GraphTesting.java:
                A sample unit-testing file intended for basic graph structure.
